               <h1>Gurucharan College</h1>
               <p> Gurucharan College, established on 15th July, 1935 is recognised as one of the premier institutions in the field of Collegiate education. It has carved out a distinct identity of its own in the field of higher education in the eastern part of India. The well-acclaimed reputation of the college stands not on its vast area of land, buildings constructed on it or on its enrolment strength but on its enriched academic & intellectual legacy built up during the time-span of 79 years of its life at the cost of effort and sacrifices of a batch of dedicated personalities who left no stone unturned to erect this huge edifice of higher education in this Barak Valley. Today, this institution of potential excellence is proud to have a large number of alumni who have established themselves in different professions and vocations of life in India and abroad.
              
                Since the day of its inception, under the able guidance of our founder Principal A. K. Chanda, Gurucharan College has inherited a very remarkable legacy of work culture, a sense of devotion and dedication which always inspires teaching and non-teaching staff to extend their whole-hearted support and co-operation for uninterrupted growth and development of this college. The objective of this college is : <b> ‘To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield’.</b></p>
